Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) set-up guide
==============================================

Learning to navigate *nix (Linux, Unix, Mac command line) is a core skillset for all biologists. 
Due to software requirements (and bias at Penn State), we use Windows as our default operating system for lab PCs.
As such, if you want to do any serious bioinformatics, and have it be reproducible outside of your own computer, you'll need to set up and configure the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
Once configured, you will be able to run Ubuntu\* on your Windows PC without needed to have two operating systems installed! 
*(\* I'm assuming folks will use Ubuntu here, since its the most mainstream Linux distro out there. If you want to get fancy, you probably dont need this guide!)*

**Guide 1 - Official Ubuntu guide for WSL:** [https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/stable/howto/install-ubuntu-wsl2/](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/stable/howto/install-ubuntu-wsl2/) 
*(Most guides have you run some code beforehand on PowerShell before jumping into `wsl --install` - if you're having any issues with the first step in this guide, try the next guide)*

**Guide 2 - Unofficial guide available via WindowsForum:** [https://windowsforum.com/threads/complete-guide-to-setting-up-wsl-2-on-windows-11.361491/](https://windowsforum.com/threads/complete-guide-to-setting-up-wsl-2-on-windows-11.361491/)
*(This is the guide I used to set up Linux on my desktop, with some consulting of the official Ubuntu guide on the side)*

**Guide 3 - Running Guppy on WSL to analyze Nanopore data:** [https://hackmd.io/@Miles/rkYKDHPsO](https://hackmd.io/@Miles/rkYKDHPsO)
*(Technically not a guide for WSL on its own, but has links to many other resources)*
