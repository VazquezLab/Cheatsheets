Getting Started
---------------

1. All Vazquez Lab members must complete the required safety trainings listed on our [Safety Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/VazquezLab/Cheatsheets/edit/main/Safety.md) before starting lab/field work. **Note: when you complete this training, you'll have to complete an (admittedly fun) practical safety test**
3. Either Manny or Jack will add you to the [PSU Vazquez Lab User Group](https://security.psu.edu/services/security-groups/user-managed-groups/), managed via [https://accounts.psu.edu/](https://accounts.psu.edu/). There are **two groups** you should be added to: `up.vazquezlab` and `
up.e1-vazquezlab`: the former gives you access to our lab listserv and OneDrive files, while the latter gives you access to the lab NAS (Network Attached Storage, AKA our local data backup server). 
3. You will receive invites from either Manny or Jack for the following apps using your _**@psu.edu email**_:
    1. [Github](https://github.com/): hosts the [Vazquez Lab Wiki](https://github.com/vazquezlab/) (you're already here!). Here you can find all of the lab protocols under development and our project repositories.
    2. [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/): used primarily for project management and lab chores, but also has integrations to several other apps we use.
    3. [Microsoft Teams](https://mobile.psu.edu/project/teams/): primary form of communication for the lab. Might also end up replacing ClickUp for project management - ask Manny again in 2027.
    4. [Benchling](https://benchling.com/signin/welcome): the lab's Electronic Lab Notebook: use this to develop wet lab protocols and to keep track of your experiments and notes. Do I (Manny) like it? No. Is it the best option? Mostly. Am I open to alternatives? Desperately.
    5. [iLab](https://psu.corefacilities.org/landing/328): PSU uses iLab to manage service requests for core facilities - you will need to be added to use this service. 
4. Please send a headshot and bio so you can be included on the lab website: [https://lab.vazquez.bio/people/](https://lab.vazquez.bio/people/)
5. Once you have completed all of the safety trainings, we will give you a lab walkthrough, followed by a quick safety training quiz with fun practical stuff!
