Lab Notebook:
=============


In the Vazquez Lab, All lab members are expected to have both an electronic lab notebook (ELN) and a physical lab notebook.
The goal of this approach is for the two copies to serve as both a backup and a sanity checks for each other. 
ELNs are primarily used for protocol planning, general note-taking, molecular biology planning, and for hosting finalized protocols. 
Meanwhile, the physical notebook primarily serves to record the day's work, and contains to-do lists and schedules, print-outs of the ELN pages and protocols used for lab work on said day, and all ad hoc notes and protocol deviations. 

At the end of every day and week, lab members are ***required*** to review both notebooks to ensure that the physical lab notebook has notes which faithfully track the work done during the day/week; and that all ad hoc notes and protocol deviations have been documented in the ELN. 

Both the physical and electronic lab notebooks should be well-organized, with informative titles and dates in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD), and with links to prior/subsequent notes or pages between related work done on different days. 

***It is a federal requirement that all of your notes be accessible and safely stored in the lab/online, and that records supporting Intellectual Property (IP) of the lab be conserved for at least 30 years!!!*** 

That means that your lab notebooks should be written in such a way that some random bureaucrat 30 years from now can understand clearly from start to finish what you did in a project, and that any future member of the lab will be able to review and reproduce your work ***without having to talk to you***.
